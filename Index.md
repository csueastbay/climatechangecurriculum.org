Climate change is the defining challenge now facing our planet andlimiting global warming to 1.5 degrees requires rapid, far-reaching,and unprecedented changes in how governments, industries, andsocieties function by 2030. This climate crisis demands effort fromacross all disciplines, including CS education.For this report, we reviewed the existing literature, interviewedleading experts integrating climate change into CS education andheld conversations at ITiCSE 2019 to identify how universities, de-partments, and CS educators should address climate change withinCS education.We find that the state of addressing climate change within CSeducation is immature and report on what universities have doneand what obstacles to climate change in CS education exist at thelevel of institutional, program and departmental support as well asfaculty attitude, and reactions of students.Following the IPCC, we suggest that climate change be addressedacross the CS curriculum as an urgent priority and that CS educa-tors are provided with support and resources at departmental anduniversity level. Moreover, we attempt to provide information toassist CS educators at all levels of the University structure.We created a series of recommendations on how to give ourstudents the tools and knowledge needed to adapt to a world shapedby climate change, and have identified responses, strategies, seedideas, and resources to assist educators in including climate changein CS education
